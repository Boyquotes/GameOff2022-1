# GameOff2022
A game for the Github GameOff2022 game jam

## Current ideas:

 - Action game with a lot of old movie/game clich√©s
    - Perfect fit suits from knocked out staff
    - Ticking bomb with display counting down
    - ...
 - If it ain't broke, don't fix it
 - Picture's worth a thousand words
 - Shoot yourself in the foot
    - C++
    - Buffer overflow
    - Programming?
 - A good rule of thumb
 - An apple a day keeps the doctor away
    - Selling apples to hospitals?
 - Caught me off-guard
 - He has a few loose screws
    - Some machine malfunctioning
    - Having to repair it
    - Machine keeps you away, you have to overcome the traps
    - In the end, it were only a few loose screws
