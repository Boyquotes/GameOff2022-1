# GameOff2022 (*MacCliché*)
A game for the [Github GameOff2022 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2022). The theme is *cliché*.

## Current game idea:

2d pixel art game in which the main character MacCliché must save the world from the evil Dr. Raine C. Adamson, who wants to build a dirty bomb using a particularly deadly variant of anthrax. The game is full of clichés from old Hollywood movies and video games. You are welcome to try to find all the clichés and compare them with the list of clichés that I have included.

Have a look at the [game design document](game-design-document.md) for a more detailed overview of my idea.
